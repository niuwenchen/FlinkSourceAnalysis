 * An atomic type is a type that is treated as one indivisible unit and where the entire type acts
 * as a key. The atomic type defines the method to create a comparator for this type as a key.
 * Example atomic types are the basic types (int, long, String, ...) and comparable custom classes.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to atomic types are composite types, where the type information is aware of the individual
 * fields and individual fields may be used as a key.
